# Wikipedia Viewer App

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum, found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer). The website allows users to get a list of random wikipedia entries or search for a list of wikipedia entries. It uses the wikipedia API.
