# Wikipedia Viewer App

This is a web app that uses the Wikipedia API to searching for multiple Wikipedia pages by term or randomly.

This was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's frontend curriculum. I like the colors I picked out for this design as well as its layout. The Wikipedia API doesn't give that much information so once I teach myself React I'm going to redo this project to get proper data in a layout similar to the revised Twtich.tv viewer. I'd like to do this same website but for the TvTropes website instead of Wikipedia, but their API doesn't work.

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: The random Wikipedia entries are also generated in a list rather than individual. Also the wikipedia entries open in a new page.
